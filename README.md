# Task Manager

A simple, responsive task manager web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This task manager allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter tasks, as well as mark tasks as completed.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add new tasks to the list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Edit any task text by clicking on the "Edit" button.
- **Delete Tasks**: Remove a task from the list by clicking the "Delete" button.
- **Complete Tasks**: Mark tasks as completed by checking the checkbox next to each task.
- **Filter Tasks**: Filter tasks by `All`, `Completed`, or `Incomplete`.
- **Sort Tasks**: Sort tasks by `Newest First` or `Oldest First`.
- **Task Persistence**: Tasks are saved in local storage, so your task list is retained even after refreshing the page.
